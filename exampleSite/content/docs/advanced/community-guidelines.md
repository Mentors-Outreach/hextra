Welcome to our space for sharing best practices, learning, collaborating, and connecting. As a community, we share the responsibility to keep this space safe, welcoming, inclusive, and empowering.

These rules of engagement are our way to make sure we deliver on that responsibility. It's how we behave with each other, and what we expect from each other.

## 💛 Act with Positive Intent
Treat each member and each contribution with the utmost kindness and respect. Each idea, share, and contribution should come from a place of positive intent and should add value to those receiving it. As a community, we have zero tolerance for discrimination, name-calling, shaming, bullying, NSFW content, or harassment of any type.

## 📰 Content is King
Ideas, resources, insights, questions - we love them all as long as they are clear, useful, informative, and relevant to the community we are building together.

## ©️ Copyright is Queen
We all get excited and inspired by the work done by others. If you are sharing content created by someone else, do give them a shout-out.

## 📌 Share Your Work and Promotions in a Spam-Friendly Way
'Members Gigs' is a channel for everyone to share their awesome projects, irresistible discounts, insightful ebooks, thought-provoking podcasts, articles, and conferences they speak to. We celebrate and cheer your accomplishments, but we don't appreciate spam.

## 🎙️ Community Channels
We'll bounce off a lot of insights, ideas, and questions so let's make sure we keep a sense of structure around here :) Community-wide announcement channels are closed for members' posts; All the other channels are ready for your bold ideas and existential questions; In 'Members Lounge,' you can create your channel and engage with others on a topic you are passionate about!

## 📬 Personal Messages
A private message goes a long way in nurturing human connections, so don't be shy to approach members privately for a more personal approach. Remember to keep it classy.

## 🔐 Privacy is a Big Deal
Sharing is caring, but privacy is not something to be messed around with. Please do not post any personal information or photos that you wouldn’t want to be seen by the public.

## 🕵️‍♀️ Spotted a Post That's Not Following These Operating Principles?
Anyone can report a post by hovering over the three dots and clicking "Report." A Community Manager or one of our Moderators will review and take the appropriate actions. We reserve the right to remove posts or delete accounts if they infringe on the community guidelines.
