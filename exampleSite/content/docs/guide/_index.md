We’ve built our Mentors Outreach community using Circle, an all-in-one community platform. 

Unlike social media platforms, Circle:
- Is built for communities just like ours. So whether you’re drafting a rich text post to share your insights, searching the member directory for others with similar interests, or joining us for a live event, you can engage with the community in whatever way suits you best.
- Doesn’t have ads or distractions. Forget Facebook ads and Slack pings. We’re building a community where we can connect away from the noise.
- Allows us to house everything in one place. With Circle, we’re able to keep  all community activity—discussions, resources, events, courses, chat, and more—in one easy-to-navigate place. This means that you only need to navigate one platform in order to take full advantage of your membership.
