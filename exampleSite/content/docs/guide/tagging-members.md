Tagging Members on [Mentors Outreach Community](https://social.mentorsoutreach.org/)

Here are some alternative approaches you can consider:

**Respond and Mention:**
1. Create your post as usual.
2. After posting, you can reply to your own post and mention the relevant members within the comment. You can write something like "Hey @[username], I wanted to get your thoughts on this..." (replacing @[username] with the actual username of the member).

**Member Tags (if applicable):**
- Mentors Outreach community utilizes member tags, you can leverage them to reach specific groups. When creating your post, consider targeting it towards a particular member tag relevant to the topic. This will notify members with that tag and increase the chance they see your post.

**Direct Message:**
- If your message is more private or directed at a single member, you can send them a direct message through Mentors Outreach community. This ensures they receive your message directly.
