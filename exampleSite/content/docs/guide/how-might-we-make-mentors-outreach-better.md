Here's how you can share your wishes on Mentors Outreach's functionality and what new features will help you connect with the community and the Mentors Outreach team.

Liking someone else's wish works as an upvote, and the wish with the most votes will surface at the top ðŸš€

For the perfect wish, make sure your post includes: 

ðŸ’« A clear post title to summarize your wish;

ðŸ’« Share one wish per post;

ðŸ’« Keep your wish unique - if someone else has already published a similar wish, please like and comment on that post before creating a duplicate. Check out the search bar at the top to easily find similar posts.

ðŸ’« Explain your wish as detailed as possible:

- What problem it will solve?
- What should the ideal solution look like?
- When and how would you use this feature? 
- Is it a "crucial" or a "nice to have" feature? 
- Adding screenshots when applicable will make your wish come to life!
