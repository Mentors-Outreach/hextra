To find community events and RSVP, head over to [Upcoming Events](https://social.mentorsoutreach.org/c/upcoming-events/?sort=asc). From there, you’ll be able to see our upcoming events and RSVP by clicking on the RSVP button to the right of each event. Once you RSVP, you’ll also be able to add the event to your calendar.

If you’re interested in learning more about a specific event, you can click on the event title to read the full event description. Below the description, you can also comment with any questions you might have about the event, the format, or the content. 

Pro tip: RSVPing to an event ensures that you’ll receive email and in-app notifications reminding you about the event an hour before its scheduled start time—so if you’re interested in a specific event, be sure to RSVP!
