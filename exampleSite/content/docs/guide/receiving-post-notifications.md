Customizing your notification settings is the best way to stay on top of the activity in the community that you’re most interested in!

The important thing to keep in mind is that you have total control over your experience: It’s up to you to decide what you want to be notified about and how you want to be notified. 

To manage your notification settings:
- 1️⃣ Click on your profile picture in the upper corner
- 2️⃣ Click on Notifications to open your notification settings.
- 3️⃣ From here, check the notifications you want to receive and uncheck the ones you don’t

You’ll notice that you can adjust your notifications for new activity in the community (including comments on your posts, mentions, likes on your posts, etc.) and new posts (which can be adjusted for each space, so you can opt in to notifications for the spaces you care about most).
