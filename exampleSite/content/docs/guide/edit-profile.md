To set up or edit your profile, click on your profile picture in the top right corner and then select “Edit profile.”

From there, you’ll be able to:
- Upload a profile photo (we recommend using a headshot image that is 300x300 pixels)
- Update your headline, which is a brief overview of who you are and what you do
- Select your time zone
- Update your bio, where you can share a more in-depth introduction
- Add your location
- Share links to your website and social media accounts
- Set your permissions, such as whether you want your email to be visible to other community members, whether you want other members to be able to direct message you, and whether you want your profile to be displayed in the community’s member directory.


Note that member profiles are searchable, which makes it easy for members to find and connect with others in the community.
