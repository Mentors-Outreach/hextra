# Edit post content

Once you have saved a post as a draft, scheduled it, or published it within the space, you can edit the post content and settings from a desktop or mobile browser.

To edit a published post, click the More actions (three dots) icon next to the post title and select Edit post.

If you are trying to edit a draft or scheduled post, click the community name or logo in the top-left corner and select Posts. From there, hover over the post, click the More actions (three dots) icon next to the post, and select Edit post.

## Update your content

To access the basic text formatting options, such as lists, blockquotes, and headings, when adding or updating content, you can type the forward-slash (/) command and select an option from the list.

To update or add formatting to any part of your post, you can highlight the text by selecting it. A formatting bar will appear with options such as:

- Co-pilot
- Bold
- Italic
- H2 and H3 headings
- Strikethrough
- Underline
- Hyperlink

‚ÑπÔ∏è To embed a link with a preview directly within a post, press Enter after pasting the link in the editor. However, if you want to insert it as a clickable hyperlink, please press the Spacebar first after pasting the link.

To replace or remove your post cover, hover over the current cover image and select the appropriate option. If you haven't added a cover yet, click the Add cover icon in the header to add a new cover image.

To remove any uploaded content from the post, hover over the content and click the X icon.

If you‚Äôd like to remove any embedded content from the post, just like removing text, you can use the backspace or delete function.

You have the option to update image alignment to the Left or Center. To update the image alignment, hover over the image and select the icon based on your preferred alignment.

## Update post settings

While editing your post, click Settings ‚öôÔ∏è in the header of the post editor to access your post settings. Here, you can manage post‚Äôs meta information, control permissions, and add SEO information.
