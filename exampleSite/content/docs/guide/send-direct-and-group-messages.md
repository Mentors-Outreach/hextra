# Sending a Direct Message:

There are two ways to initiate a direct message on [https://social.mentorsoutreach.org/](https://social.mentorsoutreach.org/):

## Method 1: Using the Direct Messages Icon:

- Locate the Direct Messages icon in the top right corner of the [https://social.mentorsoutreach.org/](https://social.mentorsoutreach.org/) interface (both desktop and app). It resembles an envelope symbol.
- Clicking the icon will open your direct message inbox. If you haven't had any previous conversations, you'll see a new message screen.
In the "To" field, start typing the name of the member you want to message. [https://social.mentorsoutreach.org/](https://social.mentorsoutreach.org/) will suggest matching profiles as you type.
- Select the desired member from the suggestions.
- Compose your message in the text box below. You can also add emojis or format the text (bold, italics, etc.).
- Once your message is ready, click the "Send" button.

## Method 2: Sending a Direct Message from a Member's Profile:

- Navigate to the profile of the member you want to message. You can find their profile by searching for their name or clicking on their name within a post or comment.
- On the member's profile page, look for the message icon (might be an envelope symbol or a text bubble icon).
- Clicking this icon will directly open a new message window with the selected member already addressed in the "To" field.
- Compose your message and click "Send" as described in Method 1.
